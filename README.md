# Emotion-Recognition-Model-With-LSTM
This code uses a deep learning-based model to determine the emotional tone of a given sentence. The LSTM-trained model vectorizes the text and classifies it into one of six different emotion categories. It makes emotion predictions by optimizing the model with training and test data.
